/**
 * useExerciseFilter — Shared hook for the exercise filter pipeline
 *
 * LEARNING NOTES - CUSTOM HOOKS FOR SHARED LOGIC:
 *
 * 1. ANGULAR vs REACT:
 *    Angular: you'd put reusable logic in a service (@Injectable) and inject it
 *    into multiple components via DI. The service holds state and provides methods.
 *    React: custom hooks extract reusable stateful logic. Each component that
 *    calls the hook gets its own independent copy of the state — unlike Angular
 *    services which are singletons by default.
 *
 * 2. WHY THIS HOOK:
 *    HomePage, PrepPage, and ExercisePickerDialog all use the exact same filter
 *    pipeline: source filter → tag computation → tag/text filter → favorites sort.
 *    Extracting this into a hook eliminates three copies of identical code while
 *    keeping each component's filter state independent (changing filters on the
 *    home page doesn't affect the session picker dialog).
 *
 * 3. THE PIPELINE:
 *    filterBySource(selectedSource)    → all exercises for chosen source
 *    getTagsForExercises(...)          → available tags for the tag filter UI
 *    filterExercises(..., tags, text)  → exercises matching current filters
 *    sortByFavorites(..., favoriteIds) → favorites float to the top
 *
 * 4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (useMemo & useCallback):
 *
 *    useMemo — MEMOIZING COMPUTED VALUES:
 *    Angular: computed values in templates re-run on every change detection cycle.
 *    You'd use pure pipes or memoization libraries to avoid redundant work.
 *    React: useMemo caches a computed value and only recalculates when its
 *    dependencies change. Without it, the filter pipeline would run on every
 *    render — even if just the timer ticked or an unrelated state changed.
 *
 *    useCallback — STABLE FUNCTION REFERENCES:
 *    Angular: methods on a component class have stable identity (same function).
 *    React: functions defined inside a component are recreated every render.
 *    If passed as props, this can trigger unnecessary child re-renders (if the
 *    child uses React.memo). useCallback returns the same function reference
 *    unless dependencies change.
 *
 *    WHEN TO USE THEM:
 *    - useMemo: expensive computations (filtering 400+ exercises) or values
 *      passed to memoized children
 *    - useCallback: functions passed as props to memoized children, or used
 *      as dependencies in other hooks
 *    - Don't overuse — premature optimization adds complexity. Profile first.
