It gives the players and excellent view on how to endow.</p>\n\n          <h2>\n            Movies\n          </h2>\n            <p></p>\n            <div class=\"fitvids\">\n              <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"414\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uvI3q-jGt9U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"798\" wmode=\"Opaque\"></iframe>\n            </div>\n            <p>\n              <i></i>\n            </p>\n              Improvisational Exercises : Playing the \"He Said, She Said\" Improv Game\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3 pt-5 col-12 order-last order-lg-last\">\n        <div class=\"card text-black mb-3\">\n          <div class=\"card-body\">\n\n            <ul class=\"avatar-list text-left\">\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"improwiki\" alt=\"avatar improwiki\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1589/thumb_IMG_3334_2.JPG\"></a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <small>\n              last update: 2015-05-21<br>\n              by \n              <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\">Guido Boyke</a>\n            </small>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n\n\n    <div style=\"padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">\n        <div id=\"collapseLicence\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n          <strong>Lizenzinformation</strong>\n          <p style=\"font-size:11px;line-height: 1.2em;\">\n            Text is available under <a href=\"/en/lizenz\">CC BY-SA 3.0 DE</a>; additional terms may apply.

A new piece begins, the playback steps back into the semicircle and another steps forward and \"sings\" making the appropriate body or dance movements and so on.\n</p>\n\n<p>With help of this game/exercise not only warms one up, but it can also be rehearsed to (give and take) focus, presence and ensemble.\n</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3 pt-5 col-12 order-last order-lg-last\">\n        <div class=\"card text-black mb-3\">\n          <div class=\"card-body\">\n\n            <ul class=\"avatar-list text-left\">\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"improwiki\" alt=\"avatar improwiki\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1589/thumb_IMG_3334_2.JPG\"></a>\n                </li>\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"madmaddi\" alt=\"avatar madmaddi\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1822/thumb_Matti-150x150.jpg\"></a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <small>\n              last update: 2019-02-26<br>\n              by \n              <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\">Guido Boyke</a>\n            </small>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n\n\n    <div style=\"padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">\n        <div id=\"collapseLicence\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n          <strong>Lizenzinformation</strong>\n          <p style=\"font-size:11px;line-height: 1.2em;\">\n            Text is available under <a href=\"/en/lizenz\">CC BY-SA 3.0 DE</a>; additional terms may apply.

This person then says an \"a\" to their next neighbor, but pronounced differently, because each player has to make the same vowel differently: short or long, high or low, spoken or sung, etc. If players want to, they can take breaks, until they pass on their \"A\". Occasionally, they should make pauses, otherwise, the second volume is not batch or be sent: The first speech pause using the GM to loud / vocal to send the second in the round. Now for the same neighbours as the \"A\" he speaks an \"o\". This \"o\" is now shaped individually in circles. But important: It must be forwarded to the nearest neighbours only if a deliberate pause in speech in the \"A\" chain was allowed.\n</p>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Preexercise__similar_exercise\">Pre-exercise / similar exercise</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A vowel given by the quizmaster circles around.

If there are multiple groups then they need to be spread out enough so as not to interfere with one another. \n</p>\n<p><b>Modifications/Variations: </b>\n\n\n</p><ul>\n<li>You can limit the category and do something specific such as a type of clothing. \n</li>\n<li>You can also choose a new object other than fabric that can be transformed into new creative ideas. \n</li>\n</ul>\nSafety Considerations: \nNone<p></p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3 pt-5 col-12 order-last order-lg-last\">\n        <div class=\"card text-black mb-3\">\n          <div class=\"card-body\">\n\n            <ul class=\"avatar-list text-left\">\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://hamburg.improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"improwiki\" alt=\"avatar improwiki\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1589/thumb_IMG_3334_2.JPG\"></a>\n                </li>\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://hamburg.improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"madmaddi\" alt=\"avatar madmaddi\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1822/thumb_Matti-150x150.jpg\"></a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <small>\n              last update: 2019-02-22<br>\n              by \n              <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"https://hamburg.improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\">Guido Boyke</a>\n            </small>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n\n\n    <div style=\"padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">\n        <div id=\"collapseLicence\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n          <strong>Lizenzinformation</strong>\n          <p style=\"font-size:11px;line-height: 1.2em;\">\n            Text is available under <a href=\"/en/lizenz\">CC BY-SA 3.0 DE</a>; additional terms may apply.

The boss notices this, then he throws out the employee and replaces him with a new one.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3 pt-5 col-12 order-last order-lg-last\">\n        <div class=\"card text-black mb-3\">\n          <div class=\"card-body\">\n\n            <ul class=\"avatar-list text-left\">\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/en\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"improwiki\" alt=\"avatar improwiki\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1589/thumb_IMG_3334_2.JPG\"></a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <small>\n              last update: 2015-10-11<br>\n              by \n              <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/en\">Guido Boyke</a>\n            </small>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n\n\n    <div style=\"padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">\n        <div id=\"collapseLicence\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n          <strong>Lizenzinformation</strong>\n          <p style=\"font-size:11px;line-height: 1.2em;\">\n            Text is available under <a href=\"/en/lizenz\">CC BY-SA 3.0 DE</a>; additional terms may apply.

It is meant to train quick thought and action.\n</p><p>Action suggestions should be stated loudly, clearly, and directly. \nDo not say, \"I'm... baking a cake.\" Skip directly to the verb. \"Baking a cake!\"\n</p><p>Use of sound and environment is highly encouraged. \n</p><p>Makes actions with a lot of activity and alternates them with slow actions. Play with the rhythm. Surprise your teammate.\n</p><h3><span>Start immediately</span></h3><p>It is important to start immediately with the new action. For example, when you brush your teeth, you don't open the tube first and smear toothpaste on the toothbrush, but start immediately. No preparatory actions should be taken to delay or prepare for the start of the actual action.\n</p><p>Players may find it helpful to go down the alphabet when giving suggestions for actions. (Advancing aardvarks, Baking a cake, etc.)\n</p><h2><span>Variant</span></h2><p>The exercise can also be done with several players. The action does not switch back and forth between two players, but you form a circle and the action always moves one person forward.

It is meant to train quick thought and action.\n</p>\n<p>Action suggestions should be stated loudly, clearly, and directly. \nDo not say, \"I'm... baking a cake.\" Skip directly to the verb. \"Baking a cake!\"\n</p>\n<p>Use of sound and environment is highly encouraged. \n</p>\n<p>Makes actions with a lot of activity and alternates them with slow actions. Play with the rhythm.

For example, when you brush your teeth, you don't open the tube first and smear toothpaste on the toothbrush, but start immediately. No preparatory actions should be taken to delay or prepare for the start of the actual action.\n</p>\n<p>Players may find it helpful to go down the alphabet when giving suggestions for actions. (Advancing aardvarks, Baking a cake, etc.)\n</p>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Variant\">Variant</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The exercise can also be done with several players. The action does not switch back and forth between two players, but you form a circle and the action always moves one person forward. But this is rather a preliminary exercise to the Variant with two players.

One of them closes his eyes. The other one now makes a short, similar sound in short intervals, for example \"pip pip pip\" or \"toc toc toc toc\". He moves through the room, maybe squats down or turns a sharp curve. The other must try to follow him on the basis of the sounds. The leader must of course make sure that there are no collisions with the others or with objects. It is agreed that the blind person may only move as long as he or she hears the noise and stops immediately as soon as it stops.\n</p><h2><span>Guided camera</span></h2><p>The participants form pairs. One of them closes his eyes. The other one leads him through the room and aligns his head to an object like a camera. Then he presses it lightly on the head (like the shutter release button of a camera). The' blind' player then opens his eyes for a few seconds and takes the picture he sees. Then he closes his eyes again and is led to the next object.\n</p><p>You can also combine this exercise with \"robots\", the guided one becomes a \"photographer robot\".\n</p><h2><span>Guiding Hand</span></h2><p>The participants form pairs. In each pair, one player leads (A) and the other (B) follows. B does not close the eyes with this variant. A holds his palm about 20 cm in front of B's face. B now follows every movement of the hand with his head and his whole body, so that the distance between the hand and his face always remains constant. A can steer B as desired (up and down, forward, backward, turning, tilting, etc.) and B follows completely without will, like a doll, the hand.\n</p><p>One can often observe that the players perform very nice, graceful movements during this exercise - which they might never have done otherwise.\n</p><h2><span>Stick exercise</span></h2><p>This exercise involves 2 players. A broom handle is also required. At each end of the stick there is a player standing and pressing the palm of the flat hand, facing the other player, against the stick. This must not (never) be grasped. A permanent connection between the two players - without the stick falling down - therefore only exists if both of them exert sufficient pressure on the stick. One of them is the leader, he walks, moves and pushes the stick. He may also make dislocations, stop, use all possible heights between floor and ceiling, etc. The other, the \"driven\", must react permanently, i. e. exert counter-pressure in every situation by compensating for or participating in the movements, because the task is not to let the stick fall down despite the permanent movements.\n</p><h2><span>Tips and hints</span></h2><ul><li>Start slowly at first.\n</li><li>It's about working together, not fooling around.\n</li><li>When there is a bit of practice, you can change spontaneously between leading and being led over and over again.\n</li></ul>",

Of course, they are allowed to act as these figures in follow-up scenes.\nThe others do not have to play the same character continuously in the following scenes.\nThe following scenes can be played before or after the basic scene.\nThe special thing about this long form is that with every further scene for players and spectators the view of the basic scene changes, because it is \"fed\" with additional information from the following scenes.\n</p>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Example\">Example</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>Primary scene: A man groans a horse. Another one comes in with a limp and says:\"Joe, please hang up the saddle, I have to ride out - maybe I'll be gone for several days\". <br>\n</li>\n<li>Follow-up scene: The question is answered as to what the other man's name is, which relationship the two men have with each other. This happens in a flashback to their youth. It turns out they are brothers and the \"big brother\" named Jack always wanted to be sheriff. Joe was always treated as the little brother.\n</li>\n<li>Basic scene <br>\n</li>\n<li>Follow-up scene: The question is answered why Sheriff Jack is limping. This is also done with a flashback: A third player comes in and plays a bank robbery, shoots a bank employee. The bank robber has a conspicuous Mexican accent. That's where the Sheriff shows up. The bank robber shoots him in the leg and flees.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Basic scene<br>\n</li>\n<li>Follow-up scene: It is about the question of why and where Jack has to ride out. Evening scene in the saloon. First of all, the village doctor tells the sheriff that he will never be able to walk properly again. Another guest tells us at the poker game that yesterday someone in the neighboring town robbed the bank with a conspicuous Mexican accent and then fled to Fort Laramie. Jack decides to start the pursuit immediately the next morning.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Basic scene<br>\n</li>\n<li>Follow-up scene: Jack's in Fort Laramie trying to find the bank robber.\n</li>\n</ol>\netc.\n<p></p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3 pt-5 col-12 order-last order-lg-last\">\n        <div class=\"card text-black mb-3\">\n          <div class=\"card-body\">\n\n            <ul class=\"avatar-list text-left\">\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"madmaddi\" alt=\"avatar madmaddi\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1822/thumb_Matti-150x150.jpg\"></a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <small>\n              last update: 2023-02-16<br>\n              by \n              <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\">Maitti Showhopper</a>\n            </small>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n\n\n    <div style=\"padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">\n        <div id=\"collapseLicence\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n          <strong>Lizenzinformation</strong>\n          <p style=\"font-size:11px;line-height: 1.2em;\">\n            Text is available under <a href=\"/en/lizenz\">CC BY-SA 3.0 DE</a>; additional terms may apply.

You can only go one channel to the left or right with each turn. If you turn away from a show on one channel, then come back to it later, it will not resume exactly where you left it, because time has passed while you were away. Each channel will be showing something different, but if you leave a channel and come back, the same show will still be playing. Time should pass between the time you pan away from one scene and pan back again to it later. The amount of time that passes does not need to be real time. A minute could pass, a year could pass, a generation could pass, and the setting could change. Do whatever best suits the scene. Just make sure it is still the same scene. Don't cheat – it can be tempting to plan and coordinate with your scene partners while you're at the back of the circle. Don't. This is improv. Make it up on the spot. Because there will be only two people in each scene, and because each segment of each scene lasts only a few seconds, this is a great scene game for beginners. This game also forces each player to rapidly switch between two entirely different scenes, forcing players to play two entirely different characters which can be seen in sharp contrast. Players: Listen carefully for the word “Right” or “Left.” A circle that doesn't know which direction it's turning is sloppy and distracting. The number of players will equal the number of different scenes: 4 players = 4 scenes. There will be many short scenes in this game. Inevitably, a number of different kinds of scenes will arise in this game. In fact, there are certain kinds of scenes which will be found in this game that you may not find in other game. Have fun with the things that make this game unique.</p>",

If there are multiple groups then they need to be spread out enough so that the noise from the groups does not interfere with the other games.\n</p>\n<p><b>Modifications: </b>\n• Every time the storyteller says a certain word (example a city or a name) the participants must scramble to the objects.\nSafety Considerations: \n• The participants must be careful not to injury other participants or themselves when running to the objects.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3 pt-5 col-12 order-last order-lg-last\">\n        <div class=\"card text-black mb-3\">\n          <div class=\"card-body\">\n\n            <ul class=\"avatar-list text-left\">\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"improwiki\" alt=\"avatar improwiki\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1589/thumb_IMG_3334_2.JPG\"></a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <small>\n              last update: 2014-11-11<br>\n              by \n              <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\">Guido Boyke</a>\n            </small>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n\n\n    <div style=\"padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">\n        <div id=\"collapseLicence\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n          <strong>Lizenzinformation</strong>\n          <p style=\"font-size:11px;line-height: 1.2em;\">\n            Text is available under <a href=\"/en/lizenz\">CC BY-SA 3.0 DE</a>; additional terms may apply.

The salesman will \"come back to life\" as a new character within the new location, perhaps the manger interviewing the duck/man. The third actor might act as a current employee with an unnatural fear of ducks. Again, the scene must be advanced to the point that the duck/man dies.\n</li>\n<li>Rinse and repeat for the third location. Duck/man comes to life as a different character in this location, and the scene is advanced until the ex-ballerina dies.\n</li>\n<li>After the three deaths are established, the judge will call any one of the locations at random, and the actor who died in that location must immediately drop dead, and the other actors must pick up where the scene left off, dealing with the aftermath of the death.

The area to the left of the wall represents one room, the area to the right of the wall represents the other.\n</p>\n<p>Two players (the other two are standing behind the wall) start their game in one of the rooms. After the scene is established, one or both of them switches to the other room. They walk behind the wall, stop there and are replaced by the other player who is \"responsible\" for the other side and who comes out on the other side of the wall. The game always changes between rooms individually or in pairs, the more often the better, because the game lives on that. Important: the same player on the same page always remains responsible for the person he or she plays!\nIt is important to have no breaks, i. e. the moment a player disappears behind the wall on one side, his \"alter ego\" must come out on the other side with the same pace, facial expression and posture.\nImportant are frequent changes of side / room with original postures and movements, otherwise it is not funny.\n</p>\n<p>The \"wall\" can also be a two-metre-long piece of black fabric, which is attached to a wooden pole and hangs down from the ceiling (or rod).\n</p>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Variation\">Variation</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>It is played without a wall. The left or right edge of the stage has the function of a \"wall\". So if a player goes to the right (out), his alter ego comes on the left side of the stage and vice versa.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3 pt-5 col-12 order-last order-lg-last\">\n        <div class=\"card text-black mb-3\">\n          <div class=\"card-body\">\n\n            <ul class=\"avatar-list text-left\">\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"madmaddi\" alt=\"avatar madmaddi\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1822/thumb_Matti-150x150.jpg\"></a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <small>\n              last update: 2018-01-04<br>\n              by \n              <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\">Maitti Showhopper</a>\n            </small>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n\n\n    <div style=\"padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">\n        <div id=\"collapseLicence\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n          <strong>Lizenzinformation</strong>\n          <p style=\"font-size:11px;line-height: 1.2em;\">\n            Text is available under <a href=\"/en/lizenz\">CC BY-SA 3.0 DE</a>; additional terms may apply.

This is especially funny, here are the passages that the translator translated from Gromolo to Gibberish and then back again.\n</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3 pt-5 col-12 order-last order-lg-last\">\n        <div class=\"card text-black mb-3\">\n          <div class=\"card-body\">\n\n            <ul class=\"avatar-list text-left\">\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"improwiki\" alt=\"avatar improwiki\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1589/thumb_IMG_3334_2.JPG\"></a>\n                </li>\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"madmaddi\" alt=\"avatar madmaddi\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1822/thumb_Matti-150x150.jpg\"></a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <small>\n              last update: 2016-09-26<br>\n              by \n              <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\">Maitti Showhopper</a>\n            </small>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n\n\n    <div style=\"padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">\n        <div id=\"collapseLicence\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n          <strong>Lizenzinformation</strong>\n          <p style=\"font-size:11px;line-height: 1.2em;\">\n            Text is available under <a href=\"/en/lizenz\">CC BY-SA 3.0 DE</a>; additional terms may apply.

That is, the game leader decides not only which sentences should be sung, but also the specific genre.\n</p>\n<p>It can be asked of the audience (possibly in a row of seats or altogether) to call out \"That sounds like a song!\" at appropriate places. However, the inclusion of the audience can also lead to the audience always giving the suggestion in the following scenes. Therefore, it is recommended that this variation is played in the second half or the end of the show.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3 pt-5 col-12 order-last order-lg-last\">\n        <div class=\"card text-black mb-3\">\n          <div class=\"card-body\">\n\n            <ul class=\"avatar-list text-left\">\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/improwiki/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"improwiki\" alt=\"avatar improwiki\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1589/thumb_IMG_3334_2.JPG\"></a>\n                </li>\n                <li class=\"avatar-list-item\">\n                  <a href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\"><img class=\"rounded-circle\" title=\"madmaddi\" alt=\"avatar madmaddi\" src=\"/uploads/user/avatar/1822/thumb_Matti-150x150.jpg\"></a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <small>\n              last update: 2015-10-11<br>\n              by \n              <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"https://improwiki.com/profile/madmaddi/de\">Maitti Showhopper</a>\n            </small>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n\n\n    <div style=\"padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:25px;\">\n        <div id=\"collapseLicence\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n          <strong>Lizenzinformation</strong>\n          <p style=\"font-size:11px;line-height: 1.2em;\">\n            Text is available under <a href=\"/en/lizenz\">CC BY-SA 3.0 DE</a>; additional terms may apply.
