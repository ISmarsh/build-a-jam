The players\nneed to speak simultaneously and most often no one will understand the word they\nsaid, unless they both say the same word.

For example,\nif players were to call out words like limousine, space ship or laptop one\nwould wonder how this would lead to a convergence of words. The warm up is a\ngood opportunity to point of the benefits of not trying to be funny, and\nletting the comedy happen by accident. While naughty words can be funny, they\ndo not necessarily contribute to the goal of the exercise. Convergence also\nhelps players work with expansion versus explosion.

That player accepts the small fish,\nturns to the next player and says “big fish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a player were to accept a big fish and turn to give a big\nfish to next player this is a Fish Story (aka a fib). All the players in the\ncircle call out “fish story.” That player must look to the center and cast\ntheir fishing line out to another player and that player starts the circle\nagain. If a player were to call out “big fish” and mime a small fish that would\nwarrant the circle to call out “fish story.” If the player makes a hand spacing\nthat is grossly different from the first big fish or fist small fish\ndimensions, then the circle should call out “fish story.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially this exercise will sound like “big fish, small\nfish, big fish, small fish…” The leader can add complications to get the circle\nto call out Fish Story more often. The leader can add in “really big fish” with\nwider hand spacing. The leader can add in “really small fish” with even closer\nhand spacing. The leader can Where ever the leader adds in the additional fish\nsizes creates the cycle. It could sound like this “big fish, really big fish,\nsmall fish, big fish, really big fish, small fish…” If a player makes an error\nthe circle calls out “fish story,” and that player casts across the circle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complications can continue. The leader can call ask the\nplayers to reverse the size of the fish. So “big fish” becomes a small fish\nsizing, and “little fish” becomes big fish sizing. If a player messes this up\nthen “Fish Story!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they are getting bored other sea life can be added in.\n“Squid” is accompanied by wiggly hands trying to hold a struggling squid.\n“Whale” requires all the players to run into the circle to help hold up a\nwhale.

Players should feel safe and supported if they choose not to participate. </p><p>Once the players are milling about the room the leader asks them to raise their left hand and mill for a bit longer. When the chain reaction is started each player must find a left shoulder to rest their left hand on. A shoulder can only support one hand at a time. A left hand cannot rest on a right shoulder. The hand shoulder bond should not break after being connected. When working this will form collections of players that have formed into molecules. The molecules keep milling about the room.  </p><p>The chain reaction is a bit chaotic, but it is not competitive, so there is no need for players to run looking for a shoulder to connect with. </p><p>The warm up looks slightly frenetic while the hand shoulder bonds are being made.  After a few moments it settles into a random collection of circles and pairs of players bonded together. Occasionally there will be a free radical (unconnected player). The larger molecules should avoid the urge to break bonds and absorb them into the circle. Once stabilized the players return to milling and switch to a right hand right shoulder configuration. </p><p>The leader can complicate this warm up by having players raise both hands. When the chain reaction starts the players must find a shoulder for their left and right hands, but they cannot rest on the same player. So the player’s left hand must be on one player and her right hand on another player. Complicated molecules are formed. </p><p>The Chain Reaction can take place with more energy (faster) or less energy (slow motion). The nature of the reactions can be endowed with emotions. The leader can also encourage the players to have a sound effect that they make while milling. Once the molecule is formed encourage the group of players to find a new shared noise to make. </p><p>This is a warm up that allows for several teaching opportunities.

Players should feel safe and supported if they choose not to participate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the players are milling about the room the leader asks them to raise their left hand and mill for a bit longer. When the chain reaction is started each player must find a left shoulder to rest their left hand on. A shoulder can only support one hand at a time. A left hand cannot rest on a right shoulder. The hand shoulder bond should not break after being connected. When working this will form collections of players that have formed into molecules. The molecules keep milling about the room.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chain reaction is a bit chaotic, but it is not competitive, so there is no need for players to run looking for a shoulder to connect with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The warm up looks slightly frenetic while the hand shoulder bonds are being made.  After a few moments it settles into a random collection of circles and pairs of players bonded together. Occasionally there will be a free radical (unconnected player). The larger molecules should avoid the urge to break bonds and absorb them into the circle. Once stabilized the players return to milling and switch to a right hand right shoulder configuration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The leader can complicate this warm up by having players raise both hands. When the chain reaction starts the players must find a shoulder for their left and right hands, but they cannot rest on the same player. So the player’s left hand must be on one player and her right hand on another player. Complicated molecules are formed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chain Reaction can take place with more energy (faster) or less energy (slow motion). The nature of the reactions can be endowed with emotions. The leader can also encourage the players to have a sound effect that they make while milling. Once the molecule is formed encourage the group of players to find a new shared noise to make. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a warm up that allows for several teaching opportunities. The leader can encourage the players to have fun and not be competitive. It is good to accept that player may become a free radical. The group can also demonstrate supportive behaviour by moving their free shoulders towards unconnected hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gimmicks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Switch from left hand left shoulder to left hand left ankle.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https://learnimprov.com/circle-of-knots/\">Circle of Knots</a><br></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your reactions are helpful. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/support/\" rel=\"category tag\">support</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/teamwork/\" rel=\"category tag\">Teamwork</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/warm-up/\" rel=\"category tag\">Warm-Up</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/chemistry/\" rel=\"tag\">chemistry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/milling/\" rel=\"tag\">milling</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

It is\nrecommended that the prop be both safe to toss and indestructible. Most\ncommonly used is a tennis ball. The player holding the prop is assigned a\nletter from the alphabet. The player passes the prop to her left and\nimmediately starts to say as many words that start with the assigned letter.\nFor example if the player was assigned the letter P she it would sound\nsomething like: pebble, poppy, pulse, pregnant, purple. While she is listing\noff these words the prop is being passed around the circle. When the prop\nreaches her she is done. The prop is handed to another player who is assigned a\nnew letter and the process starts over. </p><p>Learn Improv is not big on competitive warm ups, however\nthis is one that usually becomes competitive. Players may pass the prop&nbsp; around the circle really fast and keep track\nof how many words the player comes up with. The leader can use this as a\nteaching opportunity for discussing the goal of support. Passing the prop\nslowly is supportive.

It is\nrecommended that the prop be both safe to toss and indestructible. Most\ncommonly used is a tennis ball. The player holding the prop is assigned a\nletter from the alphabet. The player passes the prop to her left and\nimmediately starts to say as many words that start with the assigned letter.\nFor example if the player was assigned the letter P she it would sound\nsomething like: pebble, poppy, pulse, pregnant, purple. While she is listing\noff these words the prop is being passed around the circle. When the prop\nreaches her she is done. The prop is handed to another player who is assigned a\nnew letter and the process starts over. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn Improv is not big on competitive warm ups, however\nthis is one that usually becomes competitive. Players may pass the prop&nbsp; around the circle really fast and keep track\nof how many words the player comes up with. The leader can use this as a\nteaching opportunity for discussing the goal of support. Passing the prop\nslowly is supportive. Passing the prop quickly can also be supportive if the\nplayer is completely stuck. Players will often be self critical during this\nwarm up. The leader can remind everyone that musch of improv is about failing\nwith grace and laughter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reconsider this warm up if there are players with linguistic\nchallenges in the group. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gimmicks </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Assign brutal letters like X and Z</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Categories can be done the same way.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Credits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Please help.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/ties/characters/\" rel=\"category tag\">Characters</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/\" rel=\"category tag\">Problem</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/warm-up/\" rel=\"category tag\">Warm-Up</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/circle/\" rel=\"tag\">circle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/words/\" rel=\"tag\">words</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

      "description": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p>This is a physical warm-up and ice breaker. One player is in front of the line and all players fall in behind her as she moves about the room. </p><h3>Description</h3><p>Conga Line is equivalent to Flock Dance. However if workshop space is limited and improvised Conga Line can do the trick. This is different from the official <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conga_line\">Conga dance </a>in that the lead player creates their own stylized gait and the player behind her follows and so on. </p><p>This warm up is best done with music. The first player starts a repetitive movement or dance. The two players immediately behind the lead player mimic her movements as best as possible. Each row of players follows the row of players ahead of them. Flock Dance works best if the players only try and mimic the players in the line ahead of them. There should be both a delay and a decay in the lead player’s movements.</p><p>Flock Dance is a physical warm up that also helps players by getting them to move in uncharacteristic ways. Often players will focus only on the lead player even if they are in the last line. It is important to encourage the players to only follow those directly in front of them.

One player is in front of the line and all players fall in behind her as she moves about the room. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conga Line is equivalent to Flock Dance. However if workshop space is limited and improvised Conga Line can do the trick. This is different from the official <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conga_line\">Conga dance </a>in that the lead player creates their own stylized gait and the player behind her follows and so on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This warm up is best done with music. The first player starts a repetitive movement or dance. The two players immediately behind the lead player mimic her movements as best as possible. Each row of players follows the row of players ahead of them. Flock Dance works best if the players only try and mimic the players in the line ahead of them. There should be both a delay and a decay in the lead player’s movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flock Dance is a physical warm up that also helps players by getting them to move in uncharacteristic ways. Often players will focus only on the lead player even if they are in the last line. It is important to encourage the players to only follow those directly in front of them. Players can use this as a practise for getting things wrong. Trying to do a perfect Flock Dance defeats the purpose of Flock Dance. Embrace failure, embrace chaos, and let go of being “right.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>lead player starts to move backwards</li><li>lead player flips around making the end player now the lead</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Aerobics – there is no layering of the players and everyone copies lead</li><li>Flock Dance – Lead player is the pinnacle of a pyramid</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>North America appropriation of African rhythms appropriated by Cuba.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/accepting/\" rel=\"category tag\">Accepting</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/listening/\" rel=\"category tag\">Listening</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/\" rel=\"category tag\">Problem</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/warm-up/\" rel=\"category tag\">Warm-Up</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/characters/\" rel=\"tag\">characters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/circle/\" rel=\"tag\">circle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/failure/\" rel=\"tag\">failure</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/line/\" rel=\"tag\">line</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/movement/\" rel=\"tag\">movement</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

      "description": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p>Everyone form a circle with one player in the centre. This warm-up breaks the ice, gets people listening and gets the blood flowing.</p><h3>Description</h3><p>The player in the centre of the circle starts to spin madly. They may close their eyes, they may count to ten, they may be silent. The goal of the player in the center is to “surprise” one of the players in the circle. The player in the center must make a strong and clear choice about which player in the circle has been “surprised.”</p><p>Three players in the circle must quickly form a three part bunny character. The player pointed at must mime the buck teeth, and the two players on either side of the trunk mime tall floppy ears. All three must make a carrot chewing noise like a happy bunny.  This is the simplest description of the bunny. There will be many house variations on how to create the 3 part bunny. </p><p>The challenge is to create the 3 part bunny character very quickly. There is not room for indecision. The player in the center of the circle is going to be yelling “bippity bippity bunnybop” as fast as possible. If the 3 part bunny character is not munching a carrot (fully created) before the player in the center finishes yelling “bippity bippity bunnybop” someone from the bunny character will be moved to the center. </p><p>Typically some part of the bunny will be slow to react. It may be missing a right or left ear, it’s trunk may be flaccid, or someone forgets to trumpet. Whichever player is responsible for this travesty of character development replaces the player in the circle.  The circle of life is continued until someone vomits. </p><p>Players that jump the gun and create extra ears, or extra teeth or some other mutated bunny appendage also replace the player in the center of the circle. If for some reason there is a tie or it is unclear which player messed up the 3 part bunny character the player in the center decides immediately who replaces her in the center of the circle. If the player in the center is too slow to call out their replacement they will stay in the center. </p><p>This is a great listening and commitment warm up. Players must be listening to the cue of being pointed at, as well as listening for when their neighbour has been “surprised.” It is definitely an example of listening with one’s eyes and brain instead of the usual listening for words with your ears.

This warm-up breaks the ice, gets people listening and gets the blood flowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Description</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The player in the centre of the circle starts to spin madly. They may close their eyes, they may count to ten, they may be silent. The goal of the player in the center is to “surprise” one of the players in the circle. The player in the center must make a strong and clear choice about which player in the circle has been “surprised.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three players in the circle must quickly form a three part bunny character. The player pointed at must mime the buck teeth, and the two players on either side of the trunk mime tall floppy ears. All three must make a carrot chewing noise like a happy bunny.  This is the simplest description of the bunny. There will be many house variations on how to create the 3 part bunny. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is to create the 3 part bunny character very quickly. There is not room for indecision. The player in the center of the circle is going to be yelling “bippity bippity bunnybop” as fast as possible. If the 3 part bunny character is not munching a carrot (fully created) before the player in the center finishes yelling “bippity bippity bunnybop” someone from the bunny character will be moved to the center. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically some part of the bunny will be slow to react. It may be missing a right or left ear, it’s trunk may be flaccid, or someone forgets to trumpet. Whichever player is responsible for this travesty of character development replaces the player in the circle.  The circle of life is continued until someone vomits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players that jump the gun and create extra ears, or extra teeth or some other mutated bunny appendage also replace the player in the center of the circle. If for some reason there is a tie or it is unclear which player messed up the 3 part bunny character the player in the center decides immediately who replaces her in the center of the circle. If the player in the center is too slow to call out their replacement they will stay in the center. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great listening and commitment warm up. Players must be listening to the cue of being pointed at, as well as listening for when their neighbour has been “surprised.” It is definitely an example of listening with one’s eyes and brain instead of the usual listening for words with your ears. Players must respond so fast to build their 3 part bunny character that there is no room for hesitation. Folks who overthink and worry about how they appear can get some relief with this warm up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bippity Bippity Bop is a name with two structures. Let your house decide which you will use, but be aware the there is <a muse_scanned=\"true\" href=\"https://learnimprov.com/bippity-bibbity-bop/\">Bippity Bippity Bop</a> and then there is <a muse_scanned=\"true\" href=\"https://learnimprov.com/bippity-bibbity-bopaphant/\">Bippity Bippity Bop</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gimmicks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Move from an bunny to a more complicated multi part character.

Please create a circle.</p><h3>Description</h3><p>In this warm-up one of the players throws both arms to their left or right and says ‘whoosh’. That player turns to the next player in the circle, and uses both arms to to pass on a ‘whoosh’. Thus the ‘whoosh’ whooshes around the circle in one direction. It sounds like a continuous whoosh-whoosh-whoosh with players pointing in the direction of the “whoosh.”</p><p>Once whoosh is well established then next level of the warm up is introduced. Instead of continuing the whoosh around the circle a player may change the direction of the whoosh. This is indicated by the receiving player saying  ‘wow’ and crossing their arms. When met with a wow the  whoosh changes direction. The warm up now sounds like whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-wow-whoosh (opposite direction)-whoosh-whoosh. Whooshes sound the same in both directions. </p><p>Once bidirectional whooshing has been established the next level of the warm up is introduced. At any time a player can call out “whap” instead of whoosh or wow. Whap allows the player to throw the focus across the circle. The Whap is accompanied with an overly dramatic pointing action. The player that was whapped may whoosh in either direction. </p><p>One whooshing, wowing and whapping are established it is time to introduce the next level – groovalicious. When the player calls out Groovalicious all the players lean into the circle and make their grooviest hand and upper body actions. Anyone can pick up the whoosh once these gesticulations are completed.</p><p>But wait there is more! The next level of Whoosh to introduce is Drama Lama.

Please create a circle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this warm-up one of the players throws both arms to their left or right and says ‘whoosh’. That player turns to the next player in the circle, and uses both arms to to pass on a ‘whoosh’. Thus the ‘whoosh’ whooshes around the circle in one direction. It sounds like a continuous whoosh-whoosh-whoosh with players pointing in the direction of the “whoosh.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once whoosh is well established then next level of the warm up is introduced. Instead of continuing the whoosh around the circle a player may change the direction of the whoosh. This is indicated by the receiving player saying  ‘wow’ and crossing their arms. When met with a wow the  whoosh changes direction. The warm up now sounds like whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-wow-whoosh (opposite direction)-whoosh-whoosh. Whooshes sound the same in both directions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once bidirectional whooshing has been established the next level of the warm up is introduced. At any time a player can call out “whap” instead of whoosh or wow. Whap allows the player to throw the focus across the circle. The Whap is accompanied with an overly dramatic pointing action. The player that was whapped may whoosh in either direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One whooshing, wowing and whapping are established it is time to introduce the next level – groovalicious. When the player calls out Groovalicious all the players lean into the circle and make their grooviest hand and upper body actions. Anyone can pick up the whoosh once these gesticulations are completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait there is more! The next level of Whoosh to introduce is Drama Lama. When a player calls out Drama Lama all the players chaotically and histrionically run around screaming and change position in the circle.  <br>Anyone can pick up the whoosh once the choas is completed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoosh is fun and requires listening, and focus efforts. Failure is expected, supported and laughed with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gimmicks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Don’t stop adding ridiculous new actions until failure is inevitable, supported and laughed with. </li><li>change the words from whoosh, wow and whap to other random words. makes it new every time.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Simulclap</li><li>Zip Zap Zoop</li><li>Cross Circle</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>None. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/focus/\" rel=\"category tag\">Focus</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/listening/\" rel=\"category tag\">Listening</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/warm-up/\" rel=\"category tag\">Warm-Up</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/attention/\" rel=\"tag\">attention</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/circle/\" rel=\"tag\">circle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/focus/\" rel=\"tag\">focus</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

Everyone start milling about the room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The players quietly mill about the room. A designated player will unexpectedly freeze on the spot. The goal is for the rest of players to seamlessly freeze in position as well. Eventually the group will simply freeze together as one unit. When working it is lovely to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the designated player has stopped the group a few times the warm up moves to the next level.  The warm up is mad more challenging by allowing any player can initiate the group stop. With time the players will subtlety work together choosing when to stop as a group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The leader should keep an eye out and encourage the group to use subtext to group stop in sync. While it is human nature for a group to develop signals for when to stop the most will be learned from Group Stop by using subtext. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group Stop definitely is a listening warm up. At first it is listening with the eyes, freezing when you see others freeze. At it’s highest level the ensemble will be listening with its heart and brain, knowing when to stop as one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gimmicks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Endow the players with strange gaits to impair listening</li><li>Endow the players with loud vocalizations that impair listening</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Players make eye contact and greet each other</li><li>Moving By Numbers – certain number of players move, rest still.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>None</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/less/\" rel=\"category tag\">Less</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/listening/\" rel=\"category tag\">Listening</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/\" rel=\"category tag\">Problem</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/teamwork/\" rel=\"category tag\">Teamwork</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/warm-up/\" rel=\"category tag\">Warm-Up</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/endowments/\" rel=\"tag\">endowments</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/ensemble/\" rel=\"tag\">ensemble</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/listening/\" rel=\"tag\">listening</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/milling/\" rel=\"tag\">milling</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

      "name": "Cross Circle",
      "description": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p>This warm up will help us all get moving, listening and learning some names. Let’s form a large circle.</p><h3>Description</h3><p>In this warm up players will be crossing the circle to occupy another player’s spot across the circle. They signal who’s spot they are going to occupy by calling our the player’s name. After a player’s name has been called out that player call’s out another players name and moves toward their spot. </p><p>If the above explanation worked there will always be a player walking across the circle to a new spot. If the above explanation did not work try the painfully detailed one below. </p><p>All the players are arranged in a large circle facing inwards. A player named Eh will randomly pick a player across the circle and call out their name. Let’s presume the player across the circle is named Bee. Player Eh will make eye contact, point towards and then call out “Bee.” Hopefully this will have gotten Bee’s attention. </p><p>Player Eh will start to move across the circle towards Bee. Player’s do not run across the circle. Player Eh is going to occupy player Bee’s spot so player Bee has to get moving. </p><p>Now player Bee will make eye contact with, point towards and call the name of another player in the circle. Surprisingly this new player’s name is Cee.  Bee will start casually moving towards Cee in the circle. Player Eh will now occupy the empty space in the circle left by Bee as she has now started walking towards Cee. </p><p>This can continue endlessly until fatigue or hunger sets in</p><p>This is a great warm up for learning names. Encourage players to say the names loud and clear so that others can learn names as well. However learning names barely scratches the surface of what this warm up offers. Every aspect of LACE, and more,  is demonstrated in cross circle. </p><p><strong>Listening.</strong> Clearly players must be listening for their names. That is clear enough. There is a lot more to listen for in cross circle. Players can work in listening with their eyes for the initial eye contact. Players can work on listening to the whole stage by learning names of players as others cross the circle. Emotional and subtext listening can be picked up when a player is projecting the angst of not knowing the other player’s name. </p><p><strong>Commitment.</strong>  There is tremendous social pressure to get things right, especially names. Getting players to publicly take risks regarding other players names helps build risk taking behaviour. There is not wrong. Your fellow players will support you. In improv you never know what is next. So stick to your choice loud and proud. If Nancy turns out to be Norma you will be forgiven and we all will learn as a group.</p><p><strong>Support. </strong>We feel our names are important to us.

Let’s form a large circle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this warm up players will be crossing the circle to occupy another player’s spot across the circle. They signal who’s spot they are going to occupy by calling our the player’s name. After a player’s name has been called out that player call’s out another players name and moves toward their spot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the above explanation worked there will always be a player walking across the circle to a new spot. If the above explanation did not work try the painfully detailed one below. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<p>All the players are arranged in a large circle facing inwards. A player named Eh will randomly pick a player across the circle and call out their name. Let’s presume the player across the circle is named Bee. Player Eh will make eye contact, point towards and then call out “Bee.” Hopefully this will have gotten Bee’s attention. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Player Eh will start to move across the circle towards Bee. Player’s do not run across the circle. Player Eh is going to occupy player Bee’s spot so player Bee has to get moving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now player Bee will make eye contact with, point towards and call the name of another player in the circle. Surprisingly this new player’s name is Cee.  Bee will start casually moving towards Cee in the circle. Player Eh will now occupy the empty space in the circle left by Bee as she has now started walking towards Cee. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<p>This can continue endlessly until fatigue or hunger sets in</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great warm up for learning names. Encourage players to say the names loud and clear so that others can learn names as well. However learning names barely scratches the surface of what this warm up offers. Every aspect of LACE, and more,  is demonstrated in cross circle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Listening.</strong> Clearly players must be listening for their names. That is clear enough. There is a lot more to listen for in cross circle. Players can work in listening with their eyes for the initial eye contact. Players can work on listening to the whole stage by learning names of players as others cross the circle. Emotional and subtext listening can be picked up when a player is projecting the angst of not knowing the other player’s name. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Commitment.</strong>  There is tremendous social pressure to get things right, especially names. Getting players to publicly take risks regarding other players names helps build risk taking behaviour. There is not wrong. Your fellow players will support you. In improv you never know what is next. So stick to your choice loud and proud. If Nancy turns out to be Norma you will be forgiven and we all will learn as a group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Support. </strong>We feel our names are important to us. If someone messes our name up in cross circle we will be supportive. This trains being supportive at all times. Supportive players makes cross circle work better as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Focus. </strong>Taking it. We deserve the attention of others. If we don’t get it with eye contact we point, and then we call out the player’s name. Focus is also about giving focus. Every player must throw focus to the player </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rules Not Goals.</strong> Errors are not corrected they are supported. A successful cross circle is about intent and messing it up is funny. Eventually the group of players will self correct cross circle especially once </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>High Fives – two players are crossing at once and giving high fives in the center of the circle.</li><li>Subtle Crossings – remove pointing and player naming rely on just eye contact.</li><li>Word at a Time – replace the player’s name with a word to create a word at a time story.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>None</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/listening/\" rel=\"category tag\">Listening</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/\" rel=\"category tag\">Problem</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/warm-up/\" rel=\"category tag\">Warm-Up</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/circle/\" rel=\"tag\">circle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/ice-breaker/\" rel=\"tag\">ice breaker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/lace/\" rel=\"tag\">lace</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/names/\" rel=\"tag\">names</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/walking/\" rel=\"tag\">walking</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

This warm-up breaks the ice, gets people listening and gets the blood flowing.</p><h3>Description</h3><p>The player in the centre of the circle starts to spin madly. They may close their eyes, they may count to ten, they may be silent. The goal of the player in the center is to “surprise” one of the players in the circle. The player in the center must make a strong and clear choice about which player in the circle has been “surprised.”</p><p>Three players in the circle must quickly form a three part elephant character. The player pointed at must mime the trunk, and the two players on either side of the trunk mime big floppy ears. All three must trumpet like a happy elephant together.  This is the simplest description of the elephant. There will be many house variations on how to create the 3 part elephant. </p><p>The challenge is to create the 3 part elephant character very quickly. There is not room for indecision. The player in the center of the circle is going to be yelling “bippity bippity bopaphant” as fast as possible. If the 3 part elephant character is not trumpeting (fully created) before the player in the center finishes yelling “bippity bippity bopaphant” someone from the elephant character will be moved to the center. </p><p>Typically some part of the elephant will be slow to react. It may be missing a right or left ear, it’s trunk may be flaccid, or someone forgets to trumpet. Whichever player is responsible for this travesty of character development replaces the player in the circle.  The circle of life is continued until someone vomits. </p><p>Players that jump the gun and create extra ears, or extra trunks or some other mutated elephant appendage also replace the player in the center of the circle. If for some reason there is a tie or it is unclear which player messed up the 3 part elephant character the player in the center decides immediately who replaces her in the center of the circle. If the player in the center is too slow to call out their replacement they will stay in the center. </p><p>This is a great listening and commitment warm up. Players must be listening to the cue of being pointed at, as well as listening for when their neighbour has been “surprised.” It is definitely an example of listening with one’s eyes and brain instead of the usual listening for words with your ears. Players must respond so fast to build their 3 part elephant character that there is no room for hesitation. Folks who overthink and worry about how they appear can get some relief with this warm up. </p><p> Bippity Bippity Bop is a name with two structures. Let your house decide which you will use, but be aware the there is <a href=\"https://learnimprov.com/bippity-bibbity-bop/\">Bippity Bippity Bop</a> and then there is <a href=\"https://learnimprov.com/bippity-bibbity-bopaphant/\">Bippity Bippity Bop</a>. </p><h3>Gimmicks</h3><p>Move from an elephant to a more complicated multi part character. For example a dragon with flaming mouth, two wings and a long tail. Making it asymmetric heightens the level of listening and attention to detail required. </p><p>\n\nMake up your own house characters: Charlies Angels, Church, Car, Tank, Snake, etc. \n\n</p><h3>Variations</h3><ul><li>Bippity Bippity BunnyBop – Players create a chewing bunny with two tall ears and make a carrot chewing noise. While these variations are endless bunny is very common.</li><li>Bippity Bippity Bop – No characters involved at all. Just fast talking deceit. </li></ul>",

The player pointed at must mime the trunk, and the two players on either side of the trunk mime big floppy ears. All three must trumpet like a happy elephant together.  This is the simplest description of the elephant. There will be many house variations on how to create the 3 part elephant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is to create the 3 part elephant character very quickly. There is not room for indecision. The player in the center of the circle is going to be yelling “bippity bippity bopaphant” as fast as possible. If the 3 part elephant character is not trumpeting (fully created) before the player in the center finishes yelling “bippity bippity bopaphant” someone from the elephant character will be moved to the center. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically some part of the elephant will be slow to react. It may be missing a right or left ear, it’s trunk may be flaccid, or someone forgets to trumpet. Whichever player is responsible for this travesty of character development replaces the player in the circle.  The circle of life is continued until someone vomits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players that jump the gun and create extra ears, or extra trunks or some other mutated elephant appendage also replace the player in the center of the circle. If for some reason there is a tie or it is unclear which player messed up the 3 part elephant character the player in the center decides immediately who replaces her in the center of the circle. If the player in the center is too slow to call out their replacement they will stay in the center. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great listening and commitment warm up. Players must be listening to the cue of being pointed at, as well as listening for when their neighbour has been “surprised.” It is definitely an example of listening with one’s eyes and brain instead of the usual listening for words with your ears. Players must respond so fast to build their 3 part elephant character that there is no room for hesitation. Folks who overthink and worry about how they appear can get some relief with this warm up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Bippity Bippity Bop is a name with two structures. Let your house decide which you will use, but be aware the there is <a muse_scanned=\"true\" href=\"https://learnimprov.com/bippity-bibbity-bop/\">Bippity Bippity Bop</a> and then there is <a muse_scanned=\"true\" href=\"https://learnimprov.com/bippity-bibbity-bopaphant/\">Bippity Bippity Bop</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gimmicks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Move from an elephant to a more complicated multi part character. For example a dragon with flaming mouth, two wings and a long tail. Making it asymmetric heightens the level of listening and attention to detail required. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nMake up your own house characters: Charlies Angels, Church, Car, Tank, Snake, etc. \n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Bippity Bippity BunnyBop – Players create a chewing bunny with two tall ears and make a carrot chewing noise. While these variations are endless bunny is very common.</li><li>Bippity Bippity Bop – No characters involved at all. Just fast talking deceit. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Credits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer camps throughout the ages.  I also took the liberty of renaming the elephant and bunny subs of Bippity Bippity Bop.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/listening/\" rel=\"category tag\">Listening</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/warm-up/\" rel=\"category tag\">Warm-Up</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/characters/\" rel=\"tag\">characters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/circle/\" rel=\"tag\">circle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/commitment/\" rel=\"tag\">commitment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/ice-breaker/\" rel=\"tag\">ice breaker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/listening/\" rel=\"tag\">listening</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

      "description": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p>Please form a circle. </p><h3>Description</h3><p>Categories is both an exercise and handle. This is the exercise version of the structure. </p><p>The team leader will guide the players in choosing a broad category. For example, cars, toys, cutlery, food, etc. The players will be tasked with coming up with as many references in the category as possible. There are as many ways to administer this game as their are categories to work with. </p><p>The simplest version of this is to have the players call out elements of a category around the circle. If the category was food it could sound like “dinner”, “turkey”, “ice cream”, etc. As time is spent on the category it become more challenging to come up with new ideas. The players should be encouraged to not repeat ideas. Keeping this in mind the players must be reminded it is better to commit to their first idea, even if this means repetition. </p><p>The following ways to test the category are listed in ascending complication.</p><p>Cross Circle. The players point to another player in the circle after they make their offer. This way all players have to be ready at all times with their offer. </p><p>Conducted Circle. The leader is in the middle and keeps pointing at a player for an undetermined amount of time. The chosen player must list off as many offers from the category as they can think of. </p><p>Timed Circle. Once a player is tasked with a category they must start making offers. Once they start a prop is passed around the circle and the player can only stop giving offers once the prop returns to them. </p><p>This exercise focuses on two main elements of LACE (Listen. Accept.

This is the exercise version of the structure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team leader will guide the players in choosing a broad category. For example, cars, toys, cutlery, food, etc. The players will be tasked with coming up with as many references in the category as possible. There are as many ways to administer this game as their are categories to work with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simplest version of this is to have the players call out elements of a category around the circle. If the category was food it could sound like “dinner”, “turkey”, “ice cream”, etc. As time is spent on the category it become more challenging to come up with new ideas. The players should be encouraged to not repeat ideas. Keeping this in mind the players must be reminded it is better to commit to their first idea, even if this means repetition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following ways to test the category are listed in ascending complication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross Circle. The players point to another player in the circle after they make their offer. This way all players have to be ready at all times with their offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conducted Circle. The leader is in the middle and keeps pointing at a player for an undetermined amount of time. The chosen player must list off as many offers from the category as they can think of. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timed Circle. Once a player is tasked with a category they must start making offers. Once they start a prop is passed around the circle and the player can only stop giving offers once the prop returns to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This exercise focuses on two main elements of LACE (Listen. Accept. Commit. Expand.) The player must be listening to what has gone before. The player must also commit to their offer. Pausing and thinking can be a sign a player that is second guessing their offers. It is better to be wrong and committed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gimmicks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>None.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Competitive – players can be eliminated if repeat or pause with their offer.</li><li>Cross Circle – players point to next player.</li><li>Conducted Circle – players make offers until exhausted</li><li>Timed Circle – prop is passed around the circle while the player makes offers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>None.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/exercise/\" rel=\"category tag\">Exercise</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/failure/\" rel=\"category tag\">failure</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/categories/\" rel=\"tag\">categories</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/circle/\" rel=\"tag\">circle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/prop/\" rel=\"tag\">prop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/puns/\" rel=\"tag\">puns</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

One is a lo fi version that involves no props. The other requires, get ready, sticks.</p><p>The lo fi version has two players carry out a scene where they are maintaining a specific distance from each other. The leader should set the exercise up that the players should pick distances that manageable and not touching the other player. Each player secretly decides their own distance from other player. If the two players were to pick the same distance they would hover around each other like a binary star system. If one player has chosen to be arms length away from the player, but the other player has chosen to be 6 feet away they will appear to be chasing each other around the stage. </p><p>The movement of the players should be justified within the context of the narrative they create. One player could be trying to keep warm while the other has a cold they do not want to spread. Justifications are the challenge. Narrative is the goal. It is not a game of tag. </p><p>The prop version of Sticks has the two players holding a stick between the two of them. They must not drop the stick or change hands. Make sure the stick is safe to be rotated around in a player’s hand. Brooms, rulers, pencils, can be used to keep the players at a fixed distance. The players cannot separate themselves from each other, and nor can they get closer than the stick. </p><p>Both of these exercises allow the players to explore space on stage.

One is a lo fi version that involves no props. The other requires, get ready, sticks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lo fi version has two players carry out a scene where they are maintaining a specific distance from each other. The leader should set the exercise up that the players should pick distances that manageable and not touching the other player. Each player secretly decides their own distance from other player. If the two players were to pick the same distance they would hover around each other like a binary star system. If one player has chosen to be arms length away from the player, but the other player has chosen to be 6 feet away they will appear to be chasing each other around the stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The movement of the players should be justified within the context of the narrative they create. One player could be trying to keep warm while the other has a cold they do not want to spread. Justifications are the challenge. Narrative is the goal. It is not a game of tag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prop version of Sticks has the two players holding a stick between the two of them. They must not drop the stick or change hands. Make sure the stick is safe to be rotated around in a player’s hand. Brooms, rulers, pencils, can be used to keep the players at a fixed distance. The players cannot separate themselves from each other, and nor can they get closer than the stick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these exercises allow the players to explore space on stage. The leader can also explore the player’s justifications for their actions in the environment. Challenge the players to go through doors or accomplish tasks together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gimmicks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Lo Fi </li><li>Matchstick</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Lo Fi – No sticks.</li><li>Sticks – With Sticks. <br></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributions appreciated. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/setting/environment/\" rel=\"category tag\">Environment</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/exercise/\" rel=\"category tag\">Exercise</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/setting/\" rel=\"category tag\">setting</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/broom/\" rel=\"tag\">broom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/pairs/\" rel=\"tag\">pairs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/pencil/\" rel=\"tag\">pencil</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

If using Hello as a warm up keep the salutations short and silly. Use Hello as a warm up for breaking the ice. Reminding the players that it is safe to be silly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When employing as an exercise the salutations are explored a bit longer. Encourage the players to have longer interactions. Keep the content within the realm of the salutation. inquire with players how they chose to move, and sound with the character. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gimmicks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li> Amoeba, tree, and worm gibberish.  </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>None.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>None</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/exercise/\" rel=\"category tag\">Exercise</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/characters/\" rel=\"tag\">characters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/milling/\" rel=\"tag\">milling</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

The player’s that were in the car already slowly transform their characters to match the character of the hitch hiker. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the character transformation is completed and all three players are working the same character the driver pulls over. Gets out of the car and leaves the scene (staying in character until off stage). The players shift over, remaining in character and watch for a new hitch hiker. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a character exercise</strong> Hitch Hiker offers an opportunity for players to explore new characters through imitation. Players should listen to the characters that are already in the car. The leader can encourage players to create complementary characters. A complementary character is one that informed by the character already present. For example, if an existing characters appears extroverted and loud a complementary character could be quiet and shy. Could the complementary character also be boisterous and loud? Of course.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As an environment exercise</strong> the players can practise listening to the environment of the car. How does the door open? Where are the window controls? Height and diameter of the steering wheel. Location of brake and accelerator. There is a host of opportunities to explore and practise environment using this exercise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gimmicks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Reckless driving and car crashes.</li><li>Wild and expansive characters.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Elevator – characters come and go on and elevator.</li><li>Car – exercise where players make a car feel real. <br></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributions appreciated. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/exercise/\" rel=\"category tag\">Exercise</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/handle/\" rel=\"category tag\">Handle</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/car/\" rel=\"tag\">car</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/characters/\" rel=\"tag\">characters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/mime-environment/\" rel=\"tag\">mime environment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/road-safety/\" rel=\"tag\">road safety</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

In short the open scene is improv comedy. The hundreds of structures covered in Learn Improv are there to support the open scene. All performers should be training and assessing their skill set at the open scene. All bow to the open scene.</p><p>The Open Scene has two structures. There is the exercise Open Scene and the handle Open Scene. This structure is the exercise Open Scene. This is basically “how to do improv comedy.”</p><p>There are an infinite number of ways to do an open scene. Learn Improv will discus the most expected elements of an Open Scene. This is a very reductionist approach that expects an open scene to involve the audience, have characters and a narrative arc. </p><p>Connect with your audience to get an offer that informs the scene. <strong>The offer is the defining element of improvisational comedy theatre.</strong> This involves breaking the fourth wall and connecting with the audience.  The audience becomes part of the show. The players are giving the audience what they want. </p><p>Any mechanism can be used to get the offer from the audience. Anyone can approach the audience with an Ask For. The <strong>Ask For</strong> is the question, the <strong>offer </strong>is the response. This makes the audience an collaborative member of the performance team. The Ask For can come from a host, leader, player, or performer. This is the first step in an open scene.</p><p>The offer given by the audience is the first offer in a string of offers that create a narrative. The stories created in an improv scene happen by accident. The only way this can work is by having offers moving back and forth between players. The very first offer is from the audience to the players. </p><p>Every offer is a gift and an opportunity to let comedy happen and build a story. Every offer needs to be treated carefully. It is a good idea to have tools that players can use to treat each offer with care. There are many tools for working with offers. <strong>These tools should never be rules. These tools should be goals. </strong></p><p>There are many tools for working with offers. Learn Improv uses  <a href=\"https://learnimprov.com/lace/\">LACE</a>. Listen. Accept. Commit. Expand. If a scene is not building, not being funny, not being fun it will almost always be the result of failing to reach the goals in LACE. We often see scenes that have no narrative or characters what so ever. They are quirky wonderful moments. While great chunks of narrative can be dispensed with LACE can never be dispensed with. </p><p>The players must strive to <strong>LISTEN </strong>for the offer.  When the offer is heard it must be <strong>ACCEPTED </strong>as real. The player will <strong>COMMIT </strong>to their offer. This offer will <strong>EXPAND </strong>upon the offer they heard. </p><p>Offers are flying back and forth on and what should be done with them? Improv comedy is best when it is rooted in a story. A fancy word for story is narrative. Narratives are strongest when certain elements occur. </p><p>It is recommended that the story tellers have a narrative tool to work with. There are many narrative tools out there.  <strong>These tools should never be rules. These tools should be goals. </strong> </p><p>Learn Improv uses the narrative tool <a href=\"https://learnimprov.com/steps/\">STEPS</a>. STEPS is an acronym for Setting. Ties. Exploring. Propulsing. Sorting. When we teach STEPS we often learn them in order. STEPS need not occur in order during a scene. STEPS is a narrative tool for the present player to look at see what may be missing from a narrative. </p><p>Scenes that culminate in a story are more likely to have the following. A <strong>SETTING </strong>that created and environment and mime objects. <strong>TIES </strong>between characters with real relationships. Something that is <strong>EXPLORED </strong>by the characters and connects them more deeply. The exploration is <strong>PROPELLED </strong>along making it different in some fashion. The characters that are involved in the propelled exploration will <strong>SORT </strong>things out, not nesessarily solve the exploration.</p><h3>Gimmicks</h3><ul><li>Handles – using an improv structure to overlay an open scene.</li><li>Black Out – killing a scene at the first gag or joke</li><li>Gagging – saying funny things instead of saying things funny</li><li>Deus Ex Endings – Machina, Medicina, Massacarina, etc</li></ul><h3>Variations</h3><ul><li>Scene From Nothing – Performers get on stage and start a scene without an offer.</li><li>Cold Start – Performers get on stage and start a scene without an offer</li><li>Short Form – one audience offer to one scene.</li><li>Long Form – one audience offer to many scenes. </li></ul>",

It is a good idea to have tools that players can use to treat each offer with care. There are many tools for working with offers. <strong>These tools should never be rules. These tools should be goals. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many tools for working with offers. Learn Improv uses  <a href=\"https://learnimprov.com/lace/\">LACE</a>. Listen. Accept. Commit. Expand. If a scene is not building, not being funny, not being fun it will almost always be the result of failing to reach the goals in LACE. We often see scenes that have no narrative or characters what so ever. They are quirky wonderful moments. While great chunks of narrative can be dispensed with LACE can never be dispensed with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The players must strive to <strong>LISTEN </strong>for the offer.  When the offer is heard it must be <strong>ACCEPTED </strong>as real. The player will <strong>COMMIT </strong>to their offer. This offer will <strong>EXPAND </strong>upon the offer they heard. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Offers Spark Arcs</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Offers are flying back and forth on and what should be done with them? Improv comedy is best when it is rooted in a story. A fancy word for story is narrative. Narratives are strongest when certain elements occur. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is recommended that the story tellers have a narrative tool to work with. There are many narrative tools out there.  <strong>These tools should never be rules. These tools should be goals. </strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn Improv uses the narrative tool <a href=\"https://learnimprov.com/steps/\">STEPS</a>. STEPS is an acronym for Setting. Ties. Exploring. Propulsing. Sorting. When we teach STEPS we often learn them in order. STEPS need not occur in order during a scene. STEPS is a narrative tool for the present player to look at see what may be missing from a narrative. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scenes that culminate in a story are more likely to have the following. A <strong>SETTING </strong>that created and environment and mime objects. <strong>TIES </strong>between characters with real relationships. Something that is <strong>EXPLORED </strong>by the characters and connects them more deeply. The exploration is <strong>PROPELLED </strong>along making it different in some fashion. The characters that are involved in the propelled exploration will <strong>SORT </strong>things out, not nesessarily solve the exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gimmicks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Handles – using an improv structure to overlay an open scene.</li><li>Black Out – killing a scene at the first gag or joke</li><li>Gagging – saying funny things instead of saying things funny</li><li>Deus Ex Endings – Machina, Medicina, Massacarina, etc</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Scene From Nothing – Performers get on stage and start a scene without an offer.</li><li>Cold Start – Performers get on stage and start a scene without an offer</li><li>Short Form – one audience offer to one scene.</li><li>Long Form – one audience offer to many scenes. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Credits</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Everyone everywhere living and dead.</li></ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/exercise/\" rel=\"category tag\">Exercise</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/lace/\" rel=\"tag\">lace</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/step/\" rel=\"tag\">STEPS</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

      "description": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p>Please organize into two columns facing forward.</p><h3>Description</h3><p>The player at the front of the right column steps forward. The player at the front of the left column steps forward and looks away from her.  The left  column player begins a repetitive action that uses at least three limbs.  The leader should encourage a repetitive action that is not identifiable. For example, shoveling or ladder climbing.</p><p>Once the left column player has established their repetitive action the right column player swings around to look. While turning the player calls out a tie between the two players. For example, “honey I need help with the garbage.” The leader should encourage the player to loudly call out the relationship before she can see the repetitive action. </p><p>This is the crux of Rope. An unseen player repeating a wild action is endowed with a relationship. The player doing the repetitive action must now justify the relationship and the physical actions. The response is immediate and brief. </p><p>Rope looks like this:</p><ol><li>Player on right flailing wildly. Player on left facing away.</li><li>Player on left starts turning and says “honey I need help with the garbage”</li><li>Player on the left is now facing the player on the right.</li><li>Player on the right now justifies the relationship and actions “I am picking these pixies out of the air for recycling.”</li></ol><p>Rope is a commitment exercise. </p><p>The repetitive activity The player who has turned away cannot see this repetitive action.  Before turning around to look, the player on the right endows the player making the repetitive motions with some role (profession, person, relationship). The job of the player on the left (the wiggly one) is to justify their activity in the context of what character they were endowed with. It goes something like this. The player on the right turns away so she cannot see the player on the left. The player on the left begins to pump her legs and ring circles around her head. The player on the right makes her offer and endows the player on the right, “Constable Flaherty the gnomes are on the grass again” The player on the left, who is pumping her legs and ringing circles around her head, must justify what she is doing within the context of her character. Her reply is, “I am tracking them with my radar officer Corkley.” The exercise is good for getting players away from planning and driving scenes. It also helps work on strong commitment to something that is obvious completely wrong. Both players return to the back of the line that they were not in. Once everyone has tried both endowing and justifying the exercise is done.</p><h3>Variations</h3><ul><li>Competitve – Players in the column yell “rope” if they feel the action player did not respond fast enough. Getting roped eliminates the player and new player takes that role. </li><li>Rope is a variation where the main goals are learning commitment, and being fearless on stage. The remainder of the workshoppers decide if they liked the justification or not. If not they all scream rope and are generally abusive. The player getting harassed must step forward and bow to the crowd, not being concerned at all with the abuse they are receiving. If the player flinches in any way she must immediately repeat the exercise. This version is not for the faint of heart.</li></ul>",

The response is immediate and brief. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rope looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Player on right flailing wildly. Player on left facing away.</li><li>Player on left starts turning and says “honey I need help with the garbage”</li><li>Player on the left is now facing the player on the right.</li><li>Player on the right now justifies the relationship and actions “I am picking these pixies out of the air for recycling.”</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Rope is a commitment exercise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The repetitive activity The player who has turned away cannot see this repetitive action.  Before turning around to look, the player on the right endows the player making the repetitive motions with some role (profession, person, relationship). The job of the player on the left (the wiggly one) is to justify their activity in the context of what character they were endowed with. It goes something like this. The player on the right turns away so she cannot see the player on the left. The player on the left begins to pump her legs and ring circles around her head. The player on the right makes her offer and endows the player on the right, “Constable Flaherty the gnomes are on the grass again” The player on the left, who is pumping her legs and ringing circles around her head, must justify what she is doing within the context of her character. Her reply is, “I am tracking them with my radar officer Corkley.” The exercise is good for getting players away from planning and driving scenes. It also helps work on strong commitment to something that is obvious completely wrong. Both players return to the back of the line that they were not in. Once everyone has tried both endowing and justifying the exercise is done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gimmicks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>None</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Competitve – Players in the column yell “rope” if they feel the action player did not respond fast enough. Getting roped eliminates the player and new player takes that role. </li><li>Rope is a variation where the main goals are learning commitment, and being fearless on stage. The remainder of the workshoppers decide if they liked the justification or not. If not they all scream rope and are generally abusive. The player getting harassed must step forward and bow to the crowd, not being concerned at all with the abuse they are receiving. If the player flinches in any way she must immediately repeat the exercise. This version is not for the faint of heart.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"Gary Austin (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Austin\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Austin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.groundlings.com/\">Groundlings</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/exercise/\" rel=\"category tag\">Exercise</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/ties/relationships/\" rel=\"category tag\">Relationships</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",

Sentences that explode the exploration with offer suffocation (“the dishes are on a space ship that is in our basement guarded by a zombie that has dysentery”) muddy or wreck the narrative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gimmicks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>None.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Players maintain endowed character for the multiple waves of the exercise. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_Productions\">Seattle Theatresports</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Category: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/ties/characters/\" rel=\"category tag\">Characters</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/exploration/conflict/\" rel=\"category tag\">Conflict</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/setting/environment/\" rel=\"category tag\">Environment</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/exercise/\" rel=\"category tag\">Exercise</a> <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/category/problem/\" rel=\"category tag\">Problem</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/characters/\" rel=\"tag\">characters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/endowments/\" rel=\"tag\">endowments</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/relationships/\" rel=\"tag\">relationships</a>, <a href=\"https://www.learnimprov.com/tag/step/\" rel=\"tag\">STEPS</a></span>\n\t\t\t\n           \t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t",
